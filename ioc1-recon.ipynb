    "**Indicator of Compromise (IOC) #1 – Suspicious Network Reconnaissance via External IP Scan**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Attacker Analogy**\n",
    "Technical Version:\n",
    "A cybercriminal acting like a burglar walks the perimeter of a house, quietly testing all the doors and windows to see which ones might be open or unlocked. This is an attacker’s way of probing a network perimeter using scanning tools like Nmap to check for live systems and open ports.\n",
    "\n",
    "Softened Version:\n",
    "Think of this as a digital version of a trespasser walking around your property, looking for weak spots. They're not inside yet, but they're gathering clues—seeing if the front door is open, checking for a dog in the yard. It's subtle, quiet, and preparatory. The attacker wants to find the easiest way in without raising alarms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Source of IOC (Telemetry Origin)**\n",
    "Technical Version:\n",
    "This IOC was triggered by a firewall alert indicating repeated connection attempts from an unfamiliar external IP to multiple internal hosts across several ports.\n",
    "\n",
    "Softened Version:\n",
    "The system's digital “front gate”—the firewall—noticed something odd. A stranger from the internet kept knocking on several doors inside the network, asking if anyone was home. That strange knocking triggered an alert.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Triage Framework Declaration**\n",
    "Technical Version:\n",
    "This is a Network-Based IOC. We will apply the standard network triage protocol as defined in our framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard Triage Tools for Network-Based IOC:\n",
    "\n",
    "Nmap Scan – Evaluate current port status and service exposure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Windows Event Logs (Security + System) – Review for RDP, SMB, or unexpected inbound connection attempts.\n",
    "\n",
    "NetFlow or Firewall Logs – Correlate with IP origin, timing patterns, and attempted protocols.\n",
    "\n",
    "Softened Version:\n",
    "We’re treating this like a possible break-in attempt from outside. Our first step is to do a sweep of the property using digital tools that look for open doors (Nmap), camera footage of the scene (firewall and NetFlow logs), and any inside alarms that may have gone off (Windows event logs). This gives us the big picture.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Investigative Findings**\n",
    "Technical Version:\n",
    "\n",
    "Nmap Results:\n",
    "Revealed active scanning across TCP ports 21, 22, 80, 443, and 3389 from external IP 185.203.218.77.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firewall Logs (NetFlow Correlation):\n",
    "Identified bursts of SYN packets over 40 ports within a 30-second window—a typical sign of horizontal scanning behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Windows Event Logs:\n",
    "No successful inbound connections were logged. Event ID 5156 (Filtering Platform Connection Allowed) shows attempted connections but none were accepted internally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Softened Version:\n",
    "We checked the visitor’s behavior using surveillance tools. As it tuns out,  they tested over 40 doors in just half a minute—suspicious behavior for sure. They specifically targeted known entry points like the front door (port 80), the office backdoor (3389 for RDP), and the garage (SSH on port 22). No one let them in, but they definitely tried.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Cross-Layer Interaction Pivots**\n",
    "Technical Version:\n",
    "While this IOC originated from network telemetry (e.g., Nmap TCP SYN scan), had the scan succeeded and the attacker exploited a reachable service, the follow-up activity would likely transition into host-layer analysis. Specifically, indicators might appear in Layer 1 (Process Execution Environment) if shellcode was executed, or in Layer 2 (Startup and Persistence Infrastructure) if the attacker established persistence after gaining remote access.\n",
    "\n",
    "Softened Version:\n",
    "Had any of those doors been left open, the attacker would have walked right into the house and started snooping around—or worse, installed something so they could come back later without knocking.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. OSI Layer Relevance**\n",
    "Technical Version:\n",
    "\n",
    "Layer 3 – Network: The attacker initiates scan traffic using IP-layer techniques (e.g., ICMP echo, crafted TCP/IP packets).\n",
    "\n",
    "Layer 4 – Transport: TCP SYN flag activity confirms engagement at the transport layer, providing evidence of targeted port probing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Layer 7 – Application: If any open ports return service banners (e.g., HTTP or SSH metadata), that indicates application-layer visibility, useful for identifying vulnerable services.\n",
    "\n",
    "Softened Version:\n",
    "This was clearly a Layer 3 and Layer 4 event. Think of it like someone walking down a hallway (Layer 3 – network), methodically knocking on doors—not just listening from the street. But they didn’t stop there. They actually twisted some doorknobs to see which ones might turn (Layer 4 – transport). That’s the TCP SYN packet—an active knock that expects a response. No one let them in (no application layer payload was received), but the interaction was real, and it reached into the plumbing—the transport layer—trying to find open pathways for deeper entry.\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. Attacker Behavior Interpretation**\n",
    "Technical Version:\n",
    "This reconnaissance behavior suggests a semi-automated scan using a tool like Nmap or Masscan, likely testing for common vulnerabilities. The attacker's goal is to inventory available systems and services for follow-up exploits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Softened Version:\n",
    "The attacker was casing the joint. They weren’t there to break in—yet. They were just figuring out what kind of locks are on the doors, which houses have cameras, and whether anyone’s home. This is step one in a longer plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "**8. Defender Action Summary**\n",
    "Technical Version:\n",
    "\n",
    "Immediate Action Taken:\n",
    "\n",
    "Blocked IP 185.203.218.77 at the perimeter firewall.\n",
    "\n",
    "Created alert rule for >20 ports hit in <1 minute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Preventive Measures:\n",
    "\n",
    "Conducted internal Nmap sweep to validate open ports.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implemented default-deny rule for external RDP attempts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enabled geo-IP filtering for high-risk IP ranges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Softened Version:\n",
    "We locked the door. We put this IP on the blocklist so it can’t come back. Then we walked through our property to double-check all the windows are locked. We even added a camera with motion detection to warn us earlier next time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**9. Attacker Strategy Notes**\n",
    "Technical Version:\n",
    "This actor likely falls into the Reconnaissance Phase of the MITRE ATT&CK framework. It’s not yet exploitation, but it's the preparatory stage. By collecting details about reachable services and open ports, the attacker increases their chances of a successful breach during the next phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Softened Version:\n",
    "This attacker wasn’t smashing anything—yet. They were the type that starts with a clipboard and binoculars, not a crowbar. But make no mistake: they’ll be back, better informed, and next time they might not just be looking.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion – IOC #1: Recon (External Port Scanning)**\n",
    "This case study marks the first in a structured series of Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) designed to train cybersecurity defenders by walking through both the technical forensics of an attack and the attacker mindset that drives it. Each entry adheres to a strict investigative framework but is also paired with a \"softened narrative\" — a storytelling overlay that humanizes the threat and reveals the psychological and strategic aspects of the attack. The goal is to create not only technical understanding, but true pattern recognition and attacker fluency.\n",
    "\n",
    "What This Case Represents\n",
    "This IOC captures a foundational stage in the cyber kill chain: reconnaissance — where the attacker has not yet breached the system, but is actively probing to discover what might be open, unguarded, or improperly exposed. The network scanning attempt (detected via firewall logs and Windows Event IDs) is the digital equivalent of rattling every doorknob on a locked building, searching for the easiest point of entry.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the defender’s perspective, this case highlights a few critical truths:\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all IOCs represent an intrusion. A port scan is noisy, obvious, and often thwarted — but it is also a signal of interest. It tells you your organization is being actively evaluated for weaknesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Early detection is still valuable. Just because the attacker failed doesn’t mean they’ll give up. This case emphasizes the importance of early visibility, firewall logging, and geolocation filtering as tools that can reduce noise and identify persistence patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pattern recognition begins here. This case sets the stage for understanding the full arc of an attack — because many successful breaches begin exactly this way. Future IOCs in this series will pick up where this one left off.\n",
